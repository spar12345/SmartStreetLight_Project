# SmartStreetLight_Project
This project uses an LDR sensor to detect day/night, and IR sensors to detect motion. During the night, if an object (like a human or vehicle) is detected by the IR sensor, the corresponding street light turns ON. If no object is present, the light remains OFF to save power
